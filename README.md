# Agrotech Lab 2024 
## Final Project
### Project Description
For our project, we created a system that works with a home chicken coop, and alerts when there is an egg to be picked up from the coop.
The goal of the project was to make life a bit easier, by eliminating the need to check the coop for new eggs - sometimes a couple times a day - withount knowing if there is going to be an egg, or even multiple eggs. By using different sensors, we created a system that detects when there are eggs in the laying box, and can tell the person in the kitchen if and how many eggs are there currently. Because the coop we are working with has three chickens, our system can detect up to three eggs, but could be easily tweaked to detect as many as neccessary.

### The Sensors
**Weight-** the weight sits in the chickens' laying box, covered by cardboard and some hay. When it detects any weight above 2 Kg, aka a chicken, it ignores it. After the chicken has gotten out and only the egg remains, the detected weight is 40-60 grams and a signal is sent to the screen in the kitchen to announce that there is an egg in the coop. If the detected weight is 80-120 grams or 120-180 grams, the screen will display that there are two or three eggs accordingly. 
**Motion Sensor-**
