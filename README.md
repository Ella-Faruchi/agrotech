# Agrotech Lab 2024 
## Final Project
### Project Description
For our project, we created a system that works with a home chicken coop, and alerts when there is an egg to be picked up from the coop.
The goal of the project was to make life a bit easier, by eliminating the need to check the coop for new eggs - sometimes a couple times a day - withount knowing if there is going to be an egg, or even multiple eggs. By using different sensors, we created a system that detects when there are eggs in the laying box, and can tell the person in the kitchen if and how many eggs are there currently.
